Our bachelor’s degree in French helps students develop skill in reading, writing and oral communication in French. Students acquire a deep understanding of the literature, cinema, history and traditions of one or more Francophone cultures. They perfect their linguistic skills and study various forms of cultural production from other nations. They strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret the language and culture—and gain insight into their own identities and assumptions.

## Join a Community That Cares

French students are part of a small and dynamic learning community within the larger university — which means you can benefit from one-on-one time with faculty while  establishing close bonds with your peers. Because the French program is devoted solely to undergraduate  education, students have our faculty’s full attention.

Students also have the opportunity to engage with French-speaking communities in the Greater Philadelphia area, and participate in activities promoted by French- related institutions like the Alliance Française, the French-American Chamber of Commerce, and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Washington, DC.

## Ah, Paris!

Take advantage of Temple’s excellent summer study abroad program in Paris and apply for our merit-based scholarship to defray the costs.

## Learn To Communicate. In Any Language.

We provide students with real communication skills that are in-demand in our increasingly complex and interconnected world. Our students graduate not just with French language skills, but also with an understanding of cultural differences and the ability to analyze different types of communication.

# French Program Overview

The French major helps students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while providing them with a rich understanding of the literature, cinema and traditions of one or more Francophone cultures. As they improve their linguistic skills and study various forms of cultural production, French majors also strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret in a way that enhances their overall education. Majors complete the program with an ability to communicate, a grounding in literary tradition, and an awareness of cultural differences that has become increasingly important in the world today. Majors acquire the knowledge and intellectual skills needed to participate fully in French speech communities as well as an understanding of the multicultural realities of those communities.

The French program offers a full array of courses ranging from introductory language courses to advanced-level literature, film and culture courses taught in French.

Our courses are often small, allowing students to get to know each other and their professors well.

- We have a committed and engaging faculty.
- We prepare our students to be global citizens.
- We encourage our students to study abroad.
- We invite our students to participate in the activities of the French Club and benefit from various departmental events such as film festivals.
