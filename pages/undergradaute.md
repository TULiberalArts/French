Our bachelor’s degree in French helps students develop skill in reading, writing and oral communication in French. Students acquire a deep understanding of the literature, cinema, history and traditions of one or more Francophone cultures. They perfect their linguistic skills and study various forms of cultural production from other nations. They strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret the language and culture—and gain insight into their own identities and assumptions.

## Join a Community That Cares

French students are part of a small and dynamic learning community within the larger university — which means you can benefit from one-on-one time with faculty while  establishing close bonds with your peers. Because the French program is devoted solely to undergraduate  education, students have our faculty’s full attention.

Students also have the opportunity to engage with French-speaking communities in the Greater Philadelphia area, and participate in activities promoted by French- related institutions like the Alliance Française, the French-American Chamber of Commerce, and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Washington, DC.

# French Program Overview

The French major helps students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while providing them with a rich understanding of the literature, cinema and traditions of one or more Francophone cultures. As they improve their linguistic skills and study various forms of cultural production, French majors also strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret in a way that enhances their overall education. Majors complete the program with an ability to communicate, a grounding in literary tradition, and an awareness of cultural differences that has become increasingly important in the world today. Majors acquire the knowledge and intellectual skills needed to participate fully in French speech communities as well as an understanding of the multicultural realities of those communities.

The French program offers a full array of courses ranging from introductory language courses to advanced-level literature, film and culture courses taught in French.

Our courses are often small, allowing students to get to know each other and their professors well.

- We have a committed and engaging faculty.
- We prepare our students to be global citizens.
- We encourage our students to study abroad.
- We invite our students to participate in the activities of the French Club and benefit from various departmental events such as film festivals.

## Why Study French?

A world language: More than 200 million people speak French on the five continents. La Francophonie, the international organization of French-speaking countries, comprises 68 states and governments. French is the second most widely learned foreign language after English, and the ninth most widely spoken language in the world. French is also the only language, alongside English, that is taught in every country in the world. France operates the biggest international network of cultural institutes, which run French-language courses for more than 750,000 learners.

A language for the job market: An ability to speak French and English is an advantage on the international job market. A knowledge of French opens the doors of French companies in France and other French-speaking parts of the world (Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, and North and sub-Saharan Africa). As the world’s fifth biggest economy and number-three destination for foreign investment, France is a key economic partner.

The language of culture: French is the international language of cooking, fashion, theater, the visual arts, dance and architecture. A knowledge of French offers access to great works of literature, as well as films and songs, in the original French.
A language for travel: France is the world’s number-one tourist destination and attracts more than 70 million visitors a year. A little French makes it so much more enjoyable to visit Paris and all the regions of France, offering insights into French culture, mentality and way of life. French also comes in handy when travelling to Africa, Switzerland, Canada, Monaco, the Seychelles and other places.

The other language of international relations: French is both a working language and an official language of the United Nations, the European Union, UNESCO, NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the International Red Cross and international courts. French is the language of the three cities where the EU institutions are headquartered: Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg.
A language that opens up the world: After English and German, French is the third most used language on the Internet, ahead of Spanish. An ability to understand French offers an alternative view of the world through communication with French speakers from all the continents and news from the leading French-language international media.

A language for learning other languages: French is a good base for learning other languages, especially Romance languages (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian) as well as English, since fifty per cent of current English vocabulary is derived from French.
The language of love and reason: Learning French is the pleasure of learning a beautiful, rich, melodious language, often called the language of love. French is also an analytical language that structures thought and develops critical thinking, which is a valuable skill for discussions and negotiations.
