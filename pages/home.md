A major in French allows you to immerse yourself in the study of the language, while also learning about French and Francophone cultures — from historical time periods to the present day. Become well versed in language as well as  international cinema and literature, while learning to analyze and interpret communication with a thorough understanding of cultural differences. French majors also have the opportunity to participate in Temple’s summer study program in Paris and can apply for a generous, merit-based scholarship to help cover  the costs.

Throughout your studies, you will enjoy small classes that allow you to get to know your classmates, as  well as our French faculty, who are dedicated to  undergraduate education. The French major is an excellent and dynamic path for students who are interested in the wider world and who want to gain important communication skills for navigating it successfully in local, regional, national and global perspectives.
