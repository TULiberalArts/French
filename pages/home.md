A major in French allows you to immerse yourself in the study of the language, while also learning about French and Francophone cultures — from historical time periods to the present day. Become well versed in language as well as  international cinema and literature, while learning to analyze and interpret communication with a thorough understanding of cultural differences. French majors also have the opportunity to participate in Temple’s summer study program in Paris and can apply for a generous, merit-based scholarship to help cover  the costs.

Throughout your studies, you will enjoy small classes that allow you to get to know your classmates, as  well as our French faculty, who are dedicated to  undergraduate education. The French major is an excellent and dynamic path for students who are interested in the wider world and who want to gain important communication skills for navigating it successfully in local, regional, national and global perspectives.

## Why Study French?

A world language: More than 200 million people speak French on the five continents. La Francophonie, the international organization of French-speaking countries, comprises 68 states and governments. French is the second most widely learned foreign language after English, and the ninth most widely spoken language in the world. French is also the only language, alongside English, that is taught in every country in the world. France operates the biggest international network of cultural institutes, which run French-language courses for more than 750,000 learners.

A language for the job market: An ability to speak French and English is an advantage on the international job market. A knowledge of French opens the doors of French companies in France and other French-speaking parts of the world (Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, and North and sub-Saharan Africa). As the world’s fifth biggest economy and number-three destination for foreign investment, France is a key economic partner.

The language of culture: French is the international language of cooking, fashion, theater, the visual arts, dance and architecture. A knowledge of French offers access to great works of literature, as well as films and songs, in the original French.
A language for travel: France is the world’s number-one tourist destination and attracts more than 70 million visitors a year. A little French makes it so much more enjoyable to visit Paris and all the regions of France, offering insights into French culture, mentality and way of life. French also comes in handy when travelling to Africa, Switzerland, Canada, Monaco, the Seychelles and other places.

The other language of international relations: French is both a working language and an official language of the United Nations, the European Union, UNESCO, NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the International Red Cross and international courts. French is the language of the three cities where the EU institutions are headquartered: Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg.
A language that opens up the world: After English and German, French is the third most used language on the Internet, ahead of Spanish. An ability to understand French offers an alternative view of the world through communication with French speakers from all the continents and news from the leading French-language international media.

A language for learning other languages: French is a good base for learning other languages, especially Romance languages (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian) as well as English, since fifty per cent of current English vocabulary is derived from French.
The language of love and reason: Learning French is the pleasure of learning a beautiful, rich, melodious language, often called the language of love. French is also an analytical language that structures thought and develops critical thinking, which is a valuable skill for discussions and negotiations.
