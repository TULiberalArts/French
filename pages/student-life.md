## Study Abroad in Paris
Students declaring a major or minor in French are strongly encouraged to study abroad. Temple University has a summer program at the Sorbonne in Paris where students can immerse themselves in the language and contemporary cultural life. Credits earned through the Temple Sorbonne Program may be used toward the French major, minor, certificate and for satisfaction of the GenEd World Society requirement.

Study abroad is a crucial part of language learning and intercultural development. One of the most rewarding experiences of learning French is traveling to Francophone countries to interact with native speakers and experience their cultures firsthand.
