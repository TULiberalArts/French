## Study Abroad in Paris

Students declaring a major or minor in French are strongly encouraged to study abroad. Temple University has a summer program at the Sorbonne in Paris where students can immerse themselves in the language and contemporary cultural life. Credits earned through the Temple Sorbonne Program may be used toward the French major, minor, certificate and for satisfaction of the GenEd World Society requirement.

Study abroad is a crucial part of language learning and intercultural development. One of the most rewarding experiences of learning French is traveling to Francophone countries to interact with native speakers and experience their cultures firsthand.

## Careers

The French major is a great preparation for a career that requires analytical thinking and communication skills in general, which includes the domains of education, business, government service, travel, and tourism. It is a good major or a second major for students planning to attend law or medical school. Studies have shown that learning a foreign language helps raise scores on the LSAT, GRE, and MCAT exams. This course of study also proves valuable to anyone who plans to work for a multinational corporation.

The program helps prepare students enrolled in the School of Education for careers teaching French and provides the opportunity to students enrolled in the Fox School of Business to acquire a certificate in French with a special course on French in the business world.

Recent graduates with the French major also majored in Education, Business, Political Science and History to pursue careers in the fields of education, business, law, government, social media and journalism.

Recent Temple graduates include students pursuing graduate degrees in French, High School and Middle School French teachers, numerous teaching assistants in France (in cities such as Montpellier, Nancy, Nice and Tours), a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, an executive assistant at Chanel’s American headquarters (Manhattan), a Lead Annotator at the Linguistic Data Consortium (University of Pennsylvania), and a food and travel writer who is the recent author of a guide to green spaces (Paris).
