## Careers
The French major prepares students for a career that requires analytical thinking and communication skills, which includes the domains of education, business, government service, travel and tourism. It’s a great major or a second major for students planning to attend law or medical school. Studies have shown that learning a foreign language helps raise scores on the LSAT, GRE, and MCAT exams. French also proves valuable to anyone who plans to work for a multinational corporation.

The program helps prepare students enrolled in the School of Education for careers teaching French and provides the opportunity to students enrolled in the Fox School of Business to acquire a certificate in French with a special course on French in the business world. Recent French major graduates also majored in education, business, political science and history.

Recent Temple French graduates include students pursuing graduate degrees in French, high school and middle school French teachers, numerous teaching assistants in France (in cities such as Montpellier, Nancy, Nice and Tours), a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, an executive assistant at Chanel’s American headquarters (Manhattan), a Lead Annotator at the Linguistic Data Consortium (University of Pennsylvania) and a food and travel writer who is the recent author of a guide to green spaces (Paris).
